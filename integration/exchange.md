# IoTeX Mainnet - Integration Guide

This guide provides the steps for exchanges to integarte with IoTeX blockchain. The full IoTeX documentation can be found at http://docs.iotex.io.

# 1. Deploy IoTeX Full Nodes

You'll need to deploy a few full nodes that connect to the network, for reading from and writing to the network.  The full node stores the entire blockchain state, including pending actions/transactions; and broadcast new states (blocks, actions/transactions) to the network.

Please follow [this guide](../README.md) to setup a full node running with `gateway` enabled. 

Optionally, please follow [this guide](../monitoring/README.md) to setup the dashboard for monitoring.

## Mainnet
- Config: https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-bootstrap/blob/master/config_testnet.yaml
- Genesis: https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-bootstrap/blob/master/genesis_testnet.yaml

## Testnet
- Config: https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-bootstrap/blob/master/config_mainnet.yaml
- Genesis: https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-bootstrap/blob/master/genesis_mainnet.yaml

# 2. Interact with IoTeX Full Nodes

Once the full nodes are fully synced, one can communicate with them on the [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) port specified in the configuration file. The details of APIs are specified in https://docs.iotex.io/#api-2-0, and the corresponding proto files are located at https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-core/tree/master/proto/api.

# 3. Common Integration Patterns (TBD)

## Generating Addresses
IoTeX address is generated by [this algorithm](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-address/blob/master/README.md). 

## Sending IOTX from an address

## Reading Actions from the network

# 4. Testing

Once you've fully integrated with the network, please test on both the testnet and the mainnet. All states on IoTeX blockchain can be queried through either the command line tool [ioctl](https://docs.iotex.io/#cli-command-line-interface) or the explorer ([Mainnet](https://iotexscan.io), [Testnet](https://testnet.iotexscan.io)).
