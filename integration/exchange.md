# IoTeX Mainnet - Integration Guide

This guide provides the steps for exchanges to integarte with IoTeX blockchain. The full IoTeX documentation can be found at http://docs.iotex.io.

# 1. Deploy IoTeX Full Nodes

You'll need to deploy a few full nodes that connect to the network, for reading from and writing to the network.  The full node stores the entire blockchain state, including pending actions/transactions; and broadcast new states (blocks, actions/transactions) to the network.

Please follow [this guide](../README.md) to setup a full node running with `gateway` enabled. 

Optionally, please follow [this guide](../monitoring/README.md) to setup the dashboard for monitoring.

## Mainnet
- Config: https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-bootstrap/blob/master/config_mainnet.yaml
- Genesis: https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-bootstrap/blob/master/genesis_mainnet.yaml

## Testnet
- Config: https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-bootstrap/blob/master/config_testnet.yaml
- Genesis: https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-bootstrap/blob/master/genesis_testnet.yaml

# 2. Interact with IoTeX Full Nodes

Once the full nodes are fully synced, one can communicate with them on the [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) port specified in the configuration file. The details of APIs are specified in https://docs.iotex.io/#api-2-0, and the corresponding proto files are located at https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-core/tree/master/proto/api.

# 3. Common Integration Patterns

## Generate New Accounts
IoTeX address is generated by [this algorithm](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-address/blob/master/README.md). 

Use gRPC endpoint to create new account is not supported for the time being.

If you have not installed the latest Command-line interface tool, please follow the [instructions](https://docs.iotex.io/#cli-command-line-interface) for ioctl installation. Once installed, one can create a new account which contains a public key, a private key, and an IoTeX address. An example is given [here](https://docs.iotex.io/#create-account-s).

## Send IOTX
One can evoke `/APIService/SendAction` endpoint with a signed action. An example is given [here](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-docs#sendaction).

One can use ioctl to [send IOTX from an address to another](https://docs.iotex.io/#transfer-tokens).

## Retrieve Transfers

One can retrieve confirmed transfers as well as pending (unconfirmed) transfers by using `/APIService/GetActions` endpoint. Examples are given below:
1. [Get action by action hash](https://docs.iotex.io/#getactions-2) 
2. [Get confirmed actions by address](https://docs.iotex.io/#getactions-3) 
3. [Get unconfirmed actions by address](https://docs.iotex.io/#getactions-4)
4. [Get actions by block](https://docs.iotex.io/#getactions-5)

One can use ioctl to [query an action by hash](https://docs.iotex.io/#query-action).

## Retrieve Blocks
One can retrieve blocks that contain the target transfers by using `/APIService/GetBlockMetas` endpoint. Examples are given below:
1. [Get block metadata by index](https://docs.iotex.io/#getblockmetas)
2. [Get block metadata by block hash](https://docs.iotex.io/#getblockmetas-2)

One can use ioctl to [query a block by height/hash](https://docs.iotex.io/#query-block).

# 4. Testing

Once you've fully integrated with the network, please test on both the testnet and the mainnet. All states on IoTeX blockchain can be queried through either the command line tool [ioctl](https://docs.iotex.io/#cli-command-line-interface) or the explorer ([Mainnet](https://iotexscan.io), [Testnet](https://testnet.iotexscan.io)).
