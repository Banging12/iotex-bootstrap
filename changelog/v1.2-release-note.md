# v1.2 Release Note

### v1.2.1 Release Note
1. Support multiple chain DB files. v1.2 will now generate 1 db file for every 1,000,000 accumulated blocks added to the blockchain. This prevents one single overly large db file in the long run, and opens up possibility for faster/incremental download (only need to download new latest db files)
2. Reduced DB file size. Together with the multiple DB files feature, we overhaualed the DB file itself by using an improved block storage with better compression. The estimated storage savnig is about ~30% when enabling v1.2
3. Added EVM revert message in transaction receipt. For contract calls that get reverted in the middle, we can now see the actual revert error message from the transaction receipt
4. Improved transaction indexing scheme. As a result, certain API queries (for example, pull all transactions from an address within a block range) now get a much faster response 
5. Fixed node stuck after loss of network connectivity. The network module in v1.2 is improved to detect such event, and re-connect back into the p2p network once network connectivity is resumed
6. Fix ioctl crashes in Ubuntu when creating an action
