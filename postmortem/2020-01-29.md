# Abstract

Since 01/23/2020 @ 11:53pm (UTC) epoch 6593, native stakings are not included in total votes in vote counting, only stakings on Ethereum are counted in.

# Impact
IoTeX staking in native contract are not counted in delegates’ total votes and voters/delegates are not rewarded properly.

# Root Cause
Native staking buckets are stored in a smart contract on iotex mainnet. The gas limit to read buckets data from the contract is set to 1,000,000. 1,000,000 is enough to read out buckets data when the total number of buckets are small, but not enough when the number of buckets grows to a certain threshold. On epoch 6593, we had more than 120 buckets in contract, and with 1,000,000 gas limit we are not able to read out the buckets data at all, so we end up with read out empty data.

#Timeline (PST)
01/23/2020 4AM	Chain was unable to read native staking data from native staking contract
01/28/2020 11AM	IoTeXLab(Simone) reached out to report that their native staking votes are not reflected in their rewards
01/28/2020 11AM	Protocol dev started the investigation
01/29/2020 5PM	Protocol dev identified the root cause
01/29/2020 5PM	Protocol dev began working on a patch to fix the issue

# Mitigation
A new version v0.10.2 is targeting to fix the issue. V0.10.2 is a hard fork with configuration twisting. The gas limit to read native staking buckets is increased to block gas limit and pagination size is reduced from 255 to 128.

# Next Steps
**Native staking with native go code ***
Native implementation of staking will have a much more predictable behavior, and thanks to it’s high performance, we can also simplify logic and avoid pagination.
**Better testing on edge conditions***
We thought we tested native staking pretty well, but we were wrong, we didn’t test enough. If we did test buckets with the number of pagination size, we could find the issue in first place. In future, we need to make sure we no only test end to end but also test corner to corner.
